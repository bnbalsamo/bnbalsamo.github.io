# Agenda

- What is an API?
- Why use an API?
- What is REST?
- How do you use a REST API?
- **Use a REST API!**
- What's a webhook?
- How are webhooks related to APIs?

???

- get a basic understanding of all the exciting acronyms, APIs, REST, etc
- once we know what they are, figure out how to use them
- Use an API!
- Quickly discuss webhooks if there's time.


- The majority of this talk is meant to be interacting with the API!
- Please participate, or at least look over someone elses shoulder!

# What's an API?

- **A**pplication
- **P**rogramming
- **I**nterface


- A way to interact with an application or service. 
- Optimized for automating the application or interacting with it
  from another program.
  - Interface built for _machines_, not people.

## Two Primary Types

- Local
- **Web**

???

- APIs are how programs expose functionality to outside systems
    - Useful for integration and extension!
- APIs are interfaces for machines, not people!
    - But the first step to building a program to use them
      is using one yourself!
- APIs vs RPA
    - RPA is teaching machines to use human interfaces
    - APIs are an interface built for machines
    - Both are appropriate in different scenarios

- Not all APIs are web APIs, some expose their functionality through
  a different medium, like a programming language or a non-http socket
  connection, but for the rest of this talk whenever I say API it's safe
  to assume that I'm discussing a web API.

.center[Why?]

- APIs allow different services to interact more easily.
- APIs make automation easier.
- APIs allow others to interact with their services to create more value.

???

- Lots of companies have APIs
- Useful for interoperability, exposing functionality, supporting extension, etc.
- Becoming more prevalent in environments with microservices, distributed architectures,
  single page applications, multiple front ends based on the same data, etc.
- We're going to discuss REST APIs. Not every API is a REST API, but plenty of them are. 
  APIs are organized based on what their intended use is.

### What's REST?

A method for organizing an API.

Allows for communication over HTTP!

- **Re**presentational
- **S**tate
- **T**ransfer

As opposed to...

- [SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP)
    - _Simple_ Object Access Protocol
- [RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call)
    - Remote Procedure Call
]
.col10[]
.col40[
### REST Object Types

- Collection
    - A collection of objects.

- Object
    - A representation of the state of one thing.

- Subcollection
    - A collection, limited in some way.
]
]

???

- REST is a method of organizing APIs
- **State**
    - You tell the API what state you want the objects in
        - You DON'T tell it how to get there.


- There are other kinds of APIs
    - SOAP: Precursor to REST, kind of, but didn't live up to its _simple_ name.
    - RPC: Less often implemented over HTTP, still relevant, but mostly for distributed computing.


- REST organizes information about application state into three general types.
    - Collection
    - Object
    - Subcollection


- A collection is like the whole spreadsheet
- An object is like a single row
- A subcollection is... like some rows from the spreadsheet with some quality

# A Quick HTTP Refresher

.col60[
HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol

**http**://google.com

HTTP Request --> Response Flow
- A client sends a request to a server.
- The server processes the request.
- The server sends a response to the client.

Data can be in three places in an HTTP request or response:

1. The request header
2. URL query parameters
3. The request body
]
.col10[]
.col20[
HTTP Methods

- GET
- POST
- PUT
- PATCH
- DELETE


- OPTIONS
- HEAD
]
]

???

- Web APIs utilize HTTP to communicate.

- HTTP is the same thing your browser uses

- HTTP is a request/responses protocol.
    - Client sends request to server
    - Server processes request
    - Server sends response to client

Requests and responses have a variety of ways to store data or metadata.
- Header
- Query params (url)
- The request body

HTTP requests are split up into different methods based on what the action is meant
to do.

In different contexts these methods might mean slightly different things.

In the context of APIs...

# CRUD
.cols[
.col70[
A handy acronym for remembering how you can change state in a REST API.

- **C**reate
- **R**ead
- **U**pdate
- **D**estroy

In a standard REST API HTTP methods are mapped onto these concepts.

Thus, the HTTP methods of a request represents a verb, and the endpoint (URL)
represents a noun. A request can be thought of as a simple statement.

**Different kinds of requests sent to the same endpoint have different effects!**

Endpoints return information serialized, usually in a format like [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)
or [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML).
]
.col10[]
.col20[
|  HTTP  |     | CRUD             |
|:------:|:---:|:----------------:|
|   GET  | --> | Read (list)      |
|  POST  | --> | Create           |
|   PUT  | --> | Update (Full)    |
|  PATCH | --> | Update (Partial) |
| DELETE | --> | Destroy          |
]
]

???

REST maps the HTTP verbs onto different ways to change object state.

**CRUD**

This means that a single endpoint can serve multiple purposes depending on the 
kind of request you send to it!

# An Example API

Collections
- Authors
- Quotes

Objects
- Author
- Quote

Subcollections
- Quotes by an author

???

What does our service do?

Stores data about authors and quotes.

---

# An Example API

## Author Data

|        Name       | id | Date of Birth | Date of Death | Posted At | Updated At | Quotes |
|:-----------------:|:--:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:---------:|:----------:|:------:|
| George Washington |  1 |   1732-02-22  |   1797-03-04  |    ...    |     ...    |   2,3  |
| Linus Torvalds    |  2 |   1969-12-28  |       -       |    ...    |     ...    |   1    |


## Quote Data

| id |              content              |   context   | Posted At | Updated At | Author |
|:--:|:---------------------------------:|:-----------:|:---------:|:----------:|:------:|
|  1 |  Talk is cheap. Show me the code. |      -      |    ...    |     ...    |    2   |
|  2 |        I cannot tell a lie       |      -      |    ...    |     ...    |    1   |
|  3 | It is better to offer no excuse than a bad one.| - | ...    |     ...    | 1      |


???

Data schema + relations

---

# Endpoints

- Collections
    - /authors
    - /quotes

- Objects
    - /authors/*id*
    - /quotes/*id*

- Subcollections
    - /authors/*id*/quotes

???

Endpoints to park our collections and objects at...

# Exercise 0: Read the Docs

But before we go any further hypothesizing our API...

--

How about we just take a look at it?

$API_URL/docs

# Tools

When working with APIs after a certain point a browser just doesn't cut it.

There _a ton_ of tools for working with APIs, but here are some of my favorites...


- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
    - Solid GUI application for interacting with APIs, plenty of features.
- [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/)
    - Command line tool written in python - great if you're already familiar with requests
      (the python library)
    - Strictly for HTTP, so able to make some assumptions
        - This makes for more concise commands.
    - Cross platform
- [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/)
    - Available pretty much anywhere `bash` is.
        - mac, linux, etc
    - Supports a wide range of network protocols
    - The de-facto standard

---

# Exercise 1: Authors 

- Get a list of authors
- Get an author entry
- Create an author entry

???

Live demo/walkthrough of ths one.

---

# Exercise 2: Quotes

- Get a list of quotes
- Get a quote entry
- Get a list of quotes by an author
- Create a quote entry

???

Ask people to try on their own.

---

# Exercise 3: Update an Author or Quote Entry

- Add or update an author's birth and/or death date.
- Add or update a quote's context.

???

Tricky one - PUT or PATCH can both work, but operate differently.

---

# Exercise 4: Delete Data

- Delete an author
- Delete a quote

---

# Webhooks

- A way to take an action in response to another event
    - Sometimes called "event APIs"
- Register your callback URL, specify what events to be alerted on.
    - You're now the server, rather than the client.
- The service sends you a portion of the API automatically, you take
  whatever action you want!
    - Interact with the originating API
    - Interact with a different API
    - Have a bot say something in a Teams channel
    - Send an email
    - The sky's the limit!


---

# Key Takeaways

- APIs are interfaces for machines.
    - They facilitate automation, integration, and extension.

- Many services have APIs.


- REST is a method of organizing an API and exposing state information.
    - Endpoints represent collections, objects, or subcollections
    - Endpoints are the "nouns"
    - CRUD operations are accessed via different HTTP methods
    - CRUD operations are the "verbs"
    - Each request is a simple statement of the desired state change.


- There are a variety of tools to use to interact with APIs


- Webhooks invert the client/server metaphor, and facilitate automation/reacting to events.
