# Docker for Developers
## Part 1

---

# Agenda
- Key Concepts
- What is Docker?
- What is a Container?
- Containers != VMs
- Containers ∪ VMs
- Running a Container
- Containers Alongside Your Code
- Building a Container
- Your Code in Containers

---

# Key Concepts

What you should probably know before this talk
- bash
- What a virtual machine is
- Some basic networking
- Some (very) basic network programming

What I hope this talk teaches you
- What Docker is
- What a container is
- How containers differ from VMs
    - conceptually, don't expect a libcontainer deep dive
- How to run a container
- How to use containers to help you write your code
- How to put your code in a container
- How to run your containerized code

---

# What is Docker?

> Docker is the world’s leading software container platform. Developers use Docker to eliminate “works on my machine” problems when collaborating on code with co-workers. Operators use Docker to run and manage apps side-by-side in isolated containers to get better compute density. Enterprises use Docker to build agile software delivery pipelines to ship new features faster, more securely and with confidence for both Linux, Windows Server, and Linux-on-mainframe apps.

# What is a Container?

> Containers are a way to package software in a format that can run isolated on a shared operating system. Unlike VMs, containers do not bundle a full operating system - only libraries and settings required to make the software work are needed. This makes for efficient, lightweight, self-contained systems and guarantees that software will always run the same, regardless of where it’s deployed.

# Containers != VMs

To blatantly steal a great metaphor (watch the talk linked below):

VMs package an **entire system**
- Kernel
- Drivers
- Libraries
- Software
- etc

VMs are like houses.
- Houses are freestanding buildings 
- Houses have their own plumbing, electrical, etc

# Containers != VMs, cont'd

Containers package a **service** 
- Libraries
- Application

Containers are like apartments
- There are many apartments in a single building
- Apartments share access to many key components, eg: plumbling, electrical

---

# Containers != VMs, cont'd

With this in mind, VMs and containers are typically used in different situations,
with different expectations.

- VMs are commonly used to package complex, potentially stateful, applications.
- VMs are more "permanent" after being created.
- VMs more frequently run multiple services per VM

- Containers are commonly used to package simply, usually stateless, applications.
- Containers are ephemeral, appearing and disappearing as required
- Containers often run a single service (if not single process) per container

---

# Containers ∪ VMs

Containers and Virtual Machines are different.

Containers and VMs are both appropriate in different situations.

You should probably know how to use both containers and virtual machines.

You should also know when to use containers and/or virtual machines.

(hint: the talk below helps know when to use what, watch it)
