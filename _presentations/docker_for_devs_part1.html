# What is Docker?

> Docker is the world’s leading software container platform. Developers use Docker to eliminate “works on my machine” problems when collaborating on code with co-workers. Operators use Docker to run and manage apps side-by-side in isolated containers to get better compute density. Enterprises use Docker to build agile software delivery pipelines to ship new features faster, more securely and with confidence for both Linux, Windows Server, and Linux-on-mainframe apps.

# What is a Container?

> Containers are a way to package software in a format that can run isolated on a shared operating system. Unlike VMs, containers do not bundle a full operating system - only libraries and settings required to make the software work are needed. This makes for efficient, lightweight, self-contained systems and guarantees that software will always run the same, regardless of where it’s deployed.

# Containers != VMs

To blatantly steal a great metaphor (watch the talk linked below):

VMs are like houses.
- Houses are freestanding buildings 
- Houses have their own plumbing

VMs package an **entire system**
- Kernel
- Drivers
- Libraries
- Software
- etc

# Containers != VMs, cont'd

Containers are like apartments
- Apartments share a building
- Apartments are plumbed together 

Containers package a **service** 
- Libraries
- Application

# Containers != VMs, cont'd

With this in mind, VMs and containers are typically used in different situations,
with different expectations.

VMs are commonly used to package complex, potentially stateful, applications.

VMs are more "permanent" after being created.

<hr />

Containers are commonly used to package simply, usually stateless, applications.

Containers are ephemeral, appearing and disappearing as required
