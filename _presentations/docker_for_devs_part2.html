# Docker Registries

Docker registries are network services which allow for the
simple distribution of Docker images.

Docker registries implement the [Docker Registry HTTP API](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/)
in order to allow clients to search, upload, and download docker images without
having to distribute Dockerfiles, build contexts, and other supporting material.

Docker Registries support operations on _images_ - not containers.

# Docker Registry Use Cases

Docker registries are useful for several reasons

--
- They're network accessible
    - Available to team/services/anyone with access
--
- They store built artifacts
    - Unifies built artifacts across environments/deployments
    - Caches builds, increasing speeds
    - No need to distribute build contexts
--
- They allow for organization of images
    - Relative references, versions
        - 3
        - 3.5
        - latest
        - etc

# The Parts of a Docker Registry

Docker Registries Have Parllels in Git VCS's

--

```
Registry   --> Repository --> Image  --> Tag --> Layer
```
```
Git Server --> Repository --> Branch --> Tag --> Commit
```

--

Registries contain many repositories

Repositories _may_ contain many images

Images _may_ be represented by several tags

Tags represent a collection of layers
